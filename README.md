SO when going thru it I noticed how organized the code was because when makeing website, you can get lost very easy in it because there is so much stuff that we use from bootsrap, it's just a jungle if you dont know what your looking for. When i went into inpect I start of with latop size and im pretty sure everybody elses looks grat at that point because thats where started off at. Next It was time to move on to tablet size and everything really great so far, so then I went into large, than med, and finally mobile sz but in reality no one got a phone that small so medium now will be consided mobile because that small one is on another level but i clicked on it to see if anything changed and some stuff did change but it looked good on how he organized it, other than that he did a great job on it.
