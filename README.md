SO when going thru it I noticed how organized the code was because when makeing website, you can get lost very easy in it because there is so much stuff that we use from bootsrap, it's just a jungle if you dont know what your looking for. When i went into inpect I start of with latop size and im pretty sure everybody elses looks grat at that point because thats where started off at. Next it was time to move into the different responsiveness and I noticed that the smaller there wasnt that much responsivness and so i asked here to work and get as much done before the time ends so it shows when we move on to other things like this.
